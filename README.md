## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is one of the largest Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) organizations in the world. To be a true competitor in the sport of MMA demands multiple forms of martial arts training such as boxing, wrestling, and jujitsu. In competition, two competitors fight inside a caged ring typically for a scheduled 3 or 5, 5 minute rounds. The outcome of a fight is categorized by knockout (KO), technical knockout (TKO), decision, forfeit, or no contest. To predict the outcome of a fight is complicated in nature, hence the large number of decisions made amoung the fighters that lead to the final outcome. Today, the UFC has a number of metrics that can be used to help predict the 'better' fighter. These metris may be ground control time, number of significant strikes, stance, reach, height, etc. We are interested in using this data to find and present meaningful insights.
